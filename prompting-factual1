🎓 Welcome to the College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator!
You’re about to step into a realistic college-life simulation where your decisions determine your financial stability and confidence.

You’ll play through four levels, each representing a key area of financial literacy:

Budgeting 💰

Debt & Credit Management 💳

Saving 🏦

Investing 📈

Each level includes two decision points, followed by clear, factual explanations based on real-world financial principles.
Your goal: finish college with healthy finances and a strong understanding of how money works.

🎯 Level 1: Budgeting
You’re a sophomore at a Massachusetts college, living off-campus with two roommates.
You work part-time at a café, earning about $1,000 per month after taxes.
Your monthly costs are approximately:

Rent & utilities: $600

Groceries: $200

Transportation: $100

Phone/internet: $50

That leaves $50 for discretionary spending—unless you make some changes.

Decision 1:
You notice your friends often eat out or order takeout. You could join them (it’s fun but expensive), or you could meal-prep to save money.

👉 What do you do?
A. Eat out with friends most nights — it’s worth the convenience and social time.
B. Meal-prep and cook at home — focus on saving money even if it takes more effort.

✅ You chose Option B: Meal-prep and cook at home.

Smart move — this is one of the most effective ways college students can control spending.

Let’s break down what that means financially:

Eating out costs about $12–15 per meal in Massachusetts.

Meal-prepping can bring that down to $3–5 per meal.

If you normally eat out five times a week, switching to home-cooked meals could save you around $200 per month.
That’s enough to:

Build an emergency fund,

Pay for textbooks without stressing, or

Avoid needing a credit card for basic expenses.

💡 Financial principle: This is called opportunity cost. The money you save now creates flexibility and security later — a key part of any good budget.

Next situation:
It’s mid-semester, and your laptop battery dies. You need a replacement for online classes.
You find two options:

A. A new MacBook for $1,000, with strong performance and warranty.
B. A refurbished Chromebook for $300, slightly slower but meets your needs.

Decision 2:
Which do you choose — A (new MacBook) or B (refurbished Chromebook)?

You said:

College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ You chose Option B: The refurbished Chromebook for $300.

Excellent choice — this shows smart prioritization and understanding of value vs. cost.

Here’s the breakdown:

A refurbished Chromebook gives you the function you need (internet access, word processing, streaming lectures) at less than one-third the price of a new MacBook.

Even if you upgrade later, you’ve delayed a big purchase until you’re more financially secure — that’s a classic example of delayed gratification, one of the strongest predictors of long-term financial health.

You also avoided possible credit card debt, which could have added 20%+ annual interest if you financed the MacBook.

💡 Financial principle: Distinguishing wants from needs keeps budgets stable. Buying “good enough” tools when you’re in college helps build savings and reduces dependence on loans or high-interest credit.

🎉 Level 1 Complete: Budgeting
Results:

You ended the month with a $250 surplus instead of a deficit.

You built sustainable habits (meal prepping and value-based purchasing).

You’re ready for more advanced decisions involving debt and credit.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management
You currently have:

A student loan balance of $5,000 (subsidized federal loan, 5% interest).

A credit card with a $1,000 limit and no balance yet.

You get a credit card offer in the mail:

“0% APR for 6 months + cashback rewards on all purchases!”

You’ve never carried a balance before, but it’s tempting to use it for books and personal expenses.

Decision 1:
What do you do?
A. Start using the new credit card for purchases and pay it off gradually.
B. Use your existing card only for small, budgeted purchases and pay in full each month.

You said:
A. Start using the new credit card for purchases and pay it off gradually.
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
⚠️ You chose Option A: Use the new credit card and pay it off gradually.

Let’s analyze this carefully — this is a very common real-world choice among college students, and it can be educational to see what happens.

📊 Short-term effects:
The 0% APR for 6 months means no interest for now.

You get cashback rewards, usually 1–2%, which might give you $10–20 back on a few hundred dollars of spending.

You’ll have a higher available credit limit, which can help your credit utilization ratio (a key credit score factor) if you keep balances low.

🚨 Long-term risk:
After 6 months, that 0% APR expires. The rate typically jumps to 20–25%.
If you carry even a $500 balance, that’s about $8–10 in interest per month — roughly the cost of a streaming subscription, just in fees.

If you miss a payment, your credit score could drop 60–100 points, making future borrowing (like for a car or apartment) more expensive.

💡 Financial principle: Credit cards are useful tools only if you pay them off in full and on time. Carrying a balance doesn’t improve your credit — it only costs you interest.

Now, a few months later, you’re facing a tight month financially. Your student loan grace period will end soon, and you’ll need to start making payments.

You have two options:
A. Start making interest payments now while still in school to reduce what accrues later.
B. Wait until after graduation to start paying, keeping your cash for immediate expenses.

Decision 2:
Do you:
A. Start paying interest early, or
B. Wait until repayment officially begins?

College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ You chose Option A: Start paying interest early on your student loans.

This is an excellent financial decision — one that sets you apart from most borrowers.

Let’s look at why:

📉 The math:
You currently owe $5,000 at 5% interest.

That means about $250 in interest per year, or roughly $20–25 per month.

If you pay that interest now while in school, your loan balance won’t grow — you’ll graduate still owing $5,000 instead of $5,500+ (depending on how long until repayment begins).

💡 Financial principle:
This is called preventing capitalization — stopping unpaid interest from being added to your loan balance. Once interest capitalizes, you start paying interest on your interest, which makes repayment much longer and costlier.

By making small payments now, you:

Reduce your total cost of borrowing,

Improve your debt-to-income ratio after graduation, and

Build a consistent payment history, which helps your credit score.

🎉 Level 2 Complete: Debt & Credit Management
Results:

You’re building credit responsibly.

You avoided future interest buildup on student loans.

You’ve demonstrated strong financial discipline.

🏦 Level 3: Saving
You’re now entering your junior year. You’ve built a small cushion — about $500 in your checking account.

You want to start saving but aren’t sure where to put it.

You have two options:
A. Keep all your savings in your checking account for easy access.
B. Open a high-yield savings account (HYSA) earning around 4% APY, but with limited withdrawals.

Decision 1:
Where do you put your savings — A (checking) or B (high-yield savings)?
