Here’s how your questions can be grouped into three logical categories — each representing a different dimension of financial literacy — along with realistic scenarios to illustrate them:

Category 1: Budgeting and Money Management
Example Questions:

If you earn $1,000 per month and your rent is $600, what is the maximum you should ideally spend on non-essential items based on the 50/30/20 rule?

Which of the following count as expenses you must plan for every month?

What is the difference between a “want” and a “need” when you are planning your spending?

Which statement best describes a “budget”?

Why is it important to have an emergency fund when you have limited income?

Scenario:

Jasmine is a part-time student earning $1,000 per month. After paying rent and utilities, she wants to buy concert tickets and eat out with friends. She’s unsure how much she can safely spend without falling behind on savings or bills. Her financial literacy app introduces the 50/30/20 rule to help her understand the balance between needs, wants, and savings.

This scenario focuses on practical decision-making around income allocation, expense planning, and financial discipline.

Category 2: Credit and Borrowing
Example Questions:

Credit cards always improve your credit score as long as you make the minimum payment.

Having no credit card or loan at all guarantees you have a good credit score.

When you take out a student loan, “interest” means:

If you borrow $1,000 today with an interest rate of 10% per year and make no payments, how much will you owe at the end of the year?

Which of the following actions can help build a good credit history?

Scenario:

Luis just got his first credit card. He thinks paying the minimum amount is enough to keep his credit score high. Later, he learns that carrying a balance increases his interest payments and can hurt his credit score. Meanwhile, his roommate with no credit card learns that having no credit history at all can also make it hard to rent an apartment or get a car loan.

This scenario emphasizes credit literacy, explaining how borrowing, interest, and repayment behavior affect financial standing over time.

Category 3: Financial Attitudes and Habits
Example Questions:

How much do you agree with: “Learning about budgeting and savings feels relevant to my current life situation.”

If your friend says they avoid checking their bank account because it makes them anxious, what would be the best financial advice to give?

Which of the following can help improve financial wellbeing for students?

How likely are you to apply what you learn from financial-education tools or games in your daily life?

If your savings account earns 2% annual interest, what happens if you leave $100 in it for one year?

Scenario:

Maya avoids looking at her bank account because it stresses her out. After joining a financial workshop, she learns to check her balance weekly and track small goals. Over time, she feels more confident managing her money. Her classmates discuss how budgeting tools, talking about money openly, and understanding savings interest can reduce financial anxiety.

This scenario highlights financial mindset and behavioral change, connecting emotional comfort with responsible money habits.

✅ Summary of the Three Categories:

Budgeting and Spending Management – Planning, needs vs. wants, emergency funds.

Credit and Borrowing – Understanding debt, credit scores, and responsible use.

Financial Attitudes and Habits – Confidence, motivation, and applying financial skills in real life.

Would you like me to turn these categories and scenarios into a table format or CSV file for easier use (e.g., in a survey or educational module)?
