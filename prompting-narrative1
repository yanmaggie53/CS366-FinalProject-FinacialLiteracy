🎓 Welcome to the College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator!

You’re a first-year college student at a campus in Massachusetts. Over the course of the simulation, you’ll make real-world financial decisions across four levels:

Budgeting 💵

Debt & Credit Management 💳

Saving 💰

Investing 📈

Each level presents a realistic scenario with two key decisions that affect your outcomes. After each choice, I’ll explain the financial reasoning behind what happens.

🏫 Level 1: Budgeting
You’ve just started college and are managing your first semester’s expenses.
Here’s your situation:

You have $2,000 in savings from a summer job.

Your monthly income from a part-time campus job is $400.

Your monthly expenses include:

Rent (shared apartment): $600

Food: $250

Transportation: $75

Miscellaneous (social activities, supplies, etc.): $125

That’s a total of $1,050 per month, but you earn only $400.

Decision Point 1️⃣
How do you handle the shortfall?

A. Use your savings each month to cover the difference.
B. Cut back on discretionary spending (food, social activities, etc.) to get closer to breaking even.
C. Increase income by adding more work hours or finding side gigs.

Which option do you choose?

use this scenario: It’s your first week on campus. You’ve just unpacked, met your roommate, and now you’re staring at your checking account balance on your phone.

Your financial aid refund hit your account this morning—$1,200 meant to help you cover books, food, and general expenses for the semester.

You walk into the campus bookstore and see the total for your psychology textbooks: $380. You could:
A. Buy all new books from the campus bookstore—it’s convenient and they’re right there.
B. Check online for used or rental copies, even if it takes a few days for them to arrive.

Perfect — let’s begin with your customized Level 1: Budgeting scenario.

🏫 Level 1: Budgeting — The Textbook Dilemma
It’s your first week on campus. You’ve just unpacked, met your roommate, and now you’re staring at your checking account balance on your phone.

Your financial aid refund just hit your account this morning — $1,200 meant to cover books, food, and general expenses for the semester.

You walk into the campus bookstore and see the total for your psychology textbooks: $380.

You could:

A. Buy all new books from the campus bookstore — it’s convenient, and they’re right there.
B. Check online for used or rental copies, even if it takes a few days for them to arrive.

What do you choose — A or B?

You said:
A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice A Selected: Buy all new books from the campus bookstore.

Let’s break down what happens next:

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You spend $380 out of your $1,200 refund.
That leaves you with $820 for the rest of the semester — roughly $205 per month if your semester is four months long.

While buying from the bookstore is fast and easy, new textbooks typically cost 25–60% more than used or rental options. On average, students who shop around for used or digital materials spend $100–$150 less per course per semester.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Opportunity Cost
You paid for convenience — but in doing so, you reduced your available funds for food, supplies, and emergencies later in the semester.
That $150+ in potential savings could have covered:

Two weeks of groceries 🍎

Several campus event tickets 🎟️

Part of a utility or phone bill 📱

This is called opportunity cost — the value of what you give up when choosing one option over another.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A few weeks later, you notice your food budget is running tight, and you’ve only got $180 left in your account. You can:

A. Start using your credit card for food and small expenses until your next aid disbursement.
B. Rework your budget — cut back on eating out, use your meal plan strategically, and look for campus food pantry or student discounts.

Which do you choose — A or B?

College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
Absolutely — let’s reset and run the scenario again from the start, clean and clear.

🏫 Level 1: Budgeting — The Textbook Dilemma (Restart)
It’s your first week on campus. You’ve just unpacked, met your roommate, and now you’re staring at your checking account balance on your phone.

Your financial aid refund has just landed: $1,200 meant to help you cover books, food, and general living expenses for the semester.

You head into the campus bookstore, and your psychology textbooks total $380.

You could:

A. Buy all new books from the campus bookstore — it’s convenient, and you’ll have them right away.
B. Check online for used or rental copies, even if it takes a few days for them to arrive.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
B
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice B Selected: Check online for used or rental copies.

Let’s break it down:

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You decide to shop around online. After checking a few sites (like Chegg, Amazon, or your campus buy/sell page), you find:

Used textbook bundle: $150 total

Shipping: $10
Total cost: $160

That leaves you with $1,040 of your $1,200 financial aid refund — a much healthier amount to stretch across the semester.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Smart Spending
You delayed gratification (waiting a few days for shipping) and saved $220. That’s a clear example of opportunity cost in your favor — sacrificing short-term convenience for long-term benefit.

National surveys from the College Board show that students who buy used or rent textbooks save an average of $100–$300 per semester. Those savings can directly strengthen your budget and reduce future borrowing needs.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A week later, your books arrive, and you’re managing your money carefully. You still have over $1,000 in your account.
Now you’re debating what to do with the leftover funds.

You could:

A. Treat yourself — buy new clothes, go out to eat more often, or plan a weekend trip.
B. Set aside part of your refund in a separate savings account or high-yield savings app to cover unexpected costs later in the semester.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
try this scenario instead: It’s the second week of classes. You just got your first paycheck from your campus bookstore job — $280 after taxes. You’re thrilled… until you remember your expenses this month:
$100 for textbooks
$60 for groceries
$25 for laundry & dorm supplies
$40 for social activities with friends
$15 for transportation
That totals $240. Not bad — but your roommate, Jamie, invites you to join a group weekend trip to Boston. The cost? $120, including food, train fare, and a shared Airbnb.
You have enough in your account to cover everything if you dip into what you planned to save.
A.Go on the Boston trip — you worked hard, and experiences matter too. You’ll figure out how to make up the money later.
B. Stick to your budget and skip the trip, saving the extra cash in case of emergencies or future expenses.
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
Excellent — that’s a great real-world budgeting scenario. Let’s begin.

🏫 Level 1: Budgeting — The Weekend Temptation
It’s the second week of classes, and you’ve just received your first paycheck from your campus bookstore job — $280 after taxes.

You’re feeling great… until you look over your monthly expenses:

Textbooks: $100

Groceries: $60

Laundry & dorm supplies: $25

Social activities: $40

Transportation: $15

That totals $240 — leaving you with just $40 to spare.

Then your roommate, Jamie, invites you on a weekend trip to Boston with friends. The cost: $120, including food, train fare, and a shared Airbnb.

You technically have enough in your account — but it would mean dipping into what you planned to save.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Go on the Boston trip — you worked hard, and experiences matter too. You’ll figure out how to make up the money later.
B. Stick to your budget and skip the trip, saving the extra cash in case of emergencies or future expenses.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice A Selected: Go on the Boston trip.

You decide you’ve earned a break — a quick weekend away with friends sounds worth it.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You spend $120 on the trip. After covering your $240 in essential expenses, you’ve now spent $360 total, which is $80 more than your $280 paycheck.

To cover the difference, you dip into your savings — or if you don’t have any, your checking balance will run low. That means you’ll have little to no buffer for unexpected expenses (like a last-minute class fee or a higher grocery bill).

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Short-Term Enjoyment vs. Long-Term Stability
You chose to prioritize experiential spending — which can boost happiness and social connection. In fact, research from the Journal of Consumer Psychology shows people often gain lasting satisfaction from experiences rather than material items.

However, financially, this decision highlights the concept of cash flow management: your spending this month exceeds your income. Doing this occasionally is manageable if you have savings to back it up — but over time, it can lead to debt or overdraft fees.

To stay balanced, many students adopt the 50/30/20 rule:

50% for needs

30% for wants

20% for savings/debt payments

Your spending this month leans heavily toward the “wants” category — a signal to tighten next month’s budget.

Decision Point 2️⃣
After the trip, you come back energized but broke. You realize you’ve got two weeks until your next paycheck.

You could:
A. Use a credit card for small purchases (like food or rideshares) to get by until payday.
B. Cut back temporarily — plan low-cost meals, use campus resources (like free events or food pantries), and hold off on discretionary spending.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:

College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
Got it — let’s reset and rerun the scenario cleanly from the top.

🏫 Level 1: Budgeting — The Weekend Temptation (Restart)
It’s the second week of classes, and you’ve just received your first paycheck from your campus bookstore job — $280 after taxes.

You’re feeling proud of your first earnings, but then you look at your expenses for the month:

Textbooks: $100

Groceries: $60

Laundry & dorm supplies: $25

Social activities: $40

Transportation: $15

That totals $240, leaving you with just $40 extra — not bad.

Then your roommate Jamie invites you to join a weekend trip to Boston with friends. The total cost — $120, including train fare, food, and a shared Airbnb.

You have enough to cover it if you dip into what you planned to save.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Go on the Boston trip — you worked hard, and experiences matter too. You’ll figure out how to make up the money later.
B. Stick to your budget and skip the trip, saving the extra cash in case of emergencies or future expenses.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
B
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice B Selected: Stick to your budget and skip the trip.

You decide to hold firm — Boston sounds fun, but you’d rather keep your finances stable.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You spend only $240 this month — exactly what you budgeted — leaving you with $40 left over from your $280 paycheck.

Instead of draining your account for a weekend trip, you set that $40 aside as savings or an emergency cushion.

That small buffer can make a big difference: even $40 can cover a surprise expense (like laundry card refills, forgotten class fees, or a late-night food run when your meal plan runs out).

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Paying Your Future Self First
What you just did aligns with one of the most effective budgeting principles: “Pay yourself first.”
That means treating saving like a required bill rather than an afterthought.

By skipping the trip, you’ve practiced delayed gratification — a core skill in financial success. Studies show people who consistently set aside even small amounts early on are more likely to build stable savings habits later in life.

You also avoided a potential cash flow shortfall — spending more than you earn is one of the most common financial traps for college students.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A week later, your friend Jamie tells you that another Boston trip is coming up next month — this time, it’s cheaper ($60 total) because they’re carpooling and staying with a friend.

You now have $80 saved after two paychecks.

You could:
A. Use part of your savings to join the cheaper trip — you’ve earned it, and it fits better in your budget.
B. Keep saving, aiming to build at least $200 in your emergency fund before spending on travel or non-essentials.

Which do you choose — A or B?

Great work finishing Level 1: Budgeting! 🎉

You made thoughtful choices about balancing wants and needs, building savings, and understanding opportunity cost — all key budgeting skills.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management
You’re now midway through the semester, and your finances are starting to feel more complex. You’ve got steady income from your campus job, but new responsibilities are appearing — including credit.

Here’s your current situation:

You earn $280 every two weeks.

You’ve built up $150 in savings.

You just received a credit card offer in the mail from a major bank:

Credit limit: $500

Interest rate (APR): 24%

Sign-up bonus: $25 gift card if you use it in the first month.

You’ve heard mixed things about credit cards — some friends say it’s a trap, while others say it helps build your credit score for the future.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Apply for the credit card and start using it responsibly for small purchases (like groceries or gas), paying it off in full each month.
B. Skip the credit card for now — stick to cash and debit until you’re more experienced managing money.

Which do you choose — A or B?

try this scenario: One afternoon, you’re sitting at a table in the student union when a friendly rep at a booth calls out:
“Hey! Want a free Baybridge hoodie? Just sign up for our student credit card — zero interest for the first six months!”
\You’ve been eyeing a new pair of headphones and that hoodie looks great. You’ve never had a credit card before, and the idea of “building credit” sounds important.
Your friend Jamie (ever the social one) has one and says,
“It’s fine! I just use it for food and pay it off later.”
You know having a credit card could help you build your financial reputation… but also that it could get out of hand fast if you’re not careful.
A. Sign up for the credit card — you’ll use it for small purchases like snacks or school supplies and pay it off later to start building credit.
B. Politely decline the offer — you’ll wait until you know more about how credit cards work and maybe apply through your bank later.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management — The Credit Card Booth
It’s a busy afternoon at the student union. You’re relaxing between classes when a friendly rep at a booth calls out:

“Hey! Want a free Baybridge hoodie? Just sign up for our student credit card — zero interest for the first six months!”

You’ve been eyeing a new pair of headphones, and that hoodie looks great. You’ve never had a credit card before, but the idea of “building credit” sounds important.

Your friend Jamie, who already has one, shrugs and says:

“It’s fine! I just use it for food and pay it off later.”

You know having a credit card can help build your financial reputation — but it can also become a problem if you’re not careful.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Sign up for the credit card — you’ll use it for small purchases like snacks or school supplies and pay it off later to start building credit.
B. Politely decline the offer — you’ll wait until you know more about how credit cards work and maybe apply through your bank later.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice A Selected: Sign up for the credit card.

You decide to apply for the Baybridge student credit card. After a quick approval, you’ve got your first credit line: $500. You also get that free hoodie — a small but satisfying bonus.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You start using the card for small purchases — coffee, snacks, and school supplies — keeping your spending under $100. You plan to pay it off soon.

If you pay your balance in full each month, you’ll avoid interest charges entirely. But if you carry a balance, the 24% APR (interest rate) can add up fast. For example:

If you owe $400 and only make the minimum payment ($25), it could take about 20 months to pay it off, costing you over $80 in interest.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Building Credit Wisely
By using your credit card responsibly, you’re starting to build a credit history, which affects your credit score — a key factor when renting apartments, buying a car, or qualifying for future loans.

The three most important habits for strong credit are:

Pay on time — even one missed payment can hurt your score for up to 2 years.

Keep utilization low — try not to use more than 30% of your credit limit (for you, that’s $150).

Avoid opening too many cards too soon — each new inquiry slightly lowers your score temporarily.

You’re off to a good start, but credit can quickly become dangerous if used for non-essentials or if payments slip.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A month later, you’ve built up a $200 balance on your card — mostly from coffee runs and online orders. You have $180 in your checking account and another paycheck coming soon.

You could:
A. Pay only the minimum payment ($25) to keep cash on hand for other things.
B. Pay off the entire $200 balance now to avoid interest and keep your credit utilization low.

Which do you choose — A or B?

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management — The Credit Card Booth (Restart)
It’s a sunny afternoon in the student union. You’re eating lunch when a friendly rep at a booth waves you over:

“Hey! Want a free Baybridge hoodie? Just sign up for our student credit card — zero interest for the first six months!”

You’ve been eyeing a new pair of headphones, and that hoodie looks great. You’ve never had a credit card before, but you’ve heard that building credit early can help later when renting an apartment or getting a car loan.

Your friend Jamie — who already has one — says:

“It’s fine! I just use mine for food and pay it off later.”

You understand that having a credit card can help you build financial independence — but it can also be risky if spending gets out of control.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Sign up for the credit card — you’ll use it for small purchases like snacks or school supplies and pay it off later to start building credit.
B. Politely decline the offer — you’ll wait until you know more about how credit cards work and maybe apply through your bank later.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
B\
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice B Selected: Politely decline the offer.

You smile, thank the rep for the hoodie offer, and keep walking. It’s tempting — zero interest sounds nice, and you like the idea of building credit — but you decide to wait until you understand credit cards better and can apply on your own terms.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
By not signing up at the booth, you avoid opening a credit account impulsively — a smart move, since these offers often rely on free gifts or short-term perks to attract students.

Here’s what you avoided:

High APR (24%+) after six months — meaning any balance left unpaid starts accruing expensive interest.

Potential annual fees or hidden charges.

Credit inquiries that slightly lower your score if you apply too often.

You didn’t lose out on much — you can still get a student credit card through your bank later, likely with better customer service and clearer terms.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Credit Traps vs. Credit Tools
Credit cards are powerful financial tools when used intentionally. The key difference is who’s in control:

When the card serves your goals (e.g., building credit, earning rewards responsibly), it’s a tool.

When marketing or emotion drives your decision (e.g., “free hoodie!”), it becomes a trap.

You just practiced one of the hardest financial skills to master early on — delayed decision-making.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A few weeks later, you’ve done some research and learned about credit scores and responsible card use. Your bank offers a secured student credit card that requires a $200 deposit (which becomes your credit limit).

You could:
A. Apply for the secured card through your bank to start building credit safely.
B. Continue managing money with cash and debit only until you have a stronger savings cushion.

Which do you choose — A or B?

Excellent — you’ve just blended debt management with financial aid awareness, which makes this a perfect continuation of Level 2: Debt & Credit Management.

Let’s begin.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management — The Financial Aid Refund Dilemma
It’s the second month of the semester, and you’re sitting in the student union when a rep calls out:

“Hey! Want a free Baybridge hoodie? Just sign up for our student credit card — zero interest for the first six months!”

You’ve been tempted — but as you scroll through your banking app, you notice something else: your financial aid refund just arrived.

You received $1,000 in leftover loan money after tuition and fees. You could really use it — but you also know that this is borrowed money you’ll eventually have to repay, with interest.

Your friend Jamie sees the notification and says:

“Nice! That’s your fun money for the semester — might as well enjoy it.”

You’re torn between using it for comfort now or saving yourself from more debt later.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Keep the money and use it for school supplies, food, and maybe a few personal expenses — it’s there to make your semester easier.
B. Return part or all of the refund to reduce your total loan balance and save on future interest.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice A Selected: Keep the money and use it for school supplies, food, and personal expenses.

You decide to hold onto your $1,000 financial aid refund — after all, that’s what it’s there for: to help you manage the semester comfortably without financial stress.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You deposit the refund into your checking account.
You use part of it to cover:

$150 for school supplies and lab materials

$200 for groceries and essentials

$100 for some personal spending and small luxuries

You now have about $550 left — a nice safety cushion for the rest of the term.

But remember — this isn’t “free money.” Since it came from student loans, every dollar you spend will eventually need to be repaid with interest.

For example:
If this refund is part of a federal unsubsidized loan with a 6% interest rate and a 10-year repayment plan, that $1,000 could cost about $1,330 total by the time you finish paying it back.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Borrowed vs. Earned Money
The key concept here is cost of borrowing.
Using the refund now improves your short-term comfort — but it increases your long-term debt.

If you can make this money stretch toward genuine academic or living needs (like textbooks, groceries, or transportation), you’re still using it wisely. The risk is when borrowed funds start covering wants instead of needs — that’s how student loan balances quietly grow.

Smart borrowers treat refund money as a flexible tool, not a spending bonus.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A few weeks later, you realize you still have about $400 left in your refund account. You could:

A. Move $300 into a savings account for emergencies and use the rest for essentials as needed.
B. Go ahead and spend the remainder now — on things like travel, clothes, or entertainment — since it’s already loan money anyway.

Which do you choose — A or B?

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management — The Financial Aid Refund Dilemma (Restart)
It’s the second month of the semester. You’re sitting in the student union when a friendly rep at a booth calls out:

“Hey! Want a free Baybridge hoodie? Just sign up for our student credit card — zero interest for the first six months!”

You laugh and wave them off — you’re already thinking about another piece of money news:
your financial aid refund has just landed in your bank account.

It’s $1,000 in leftover student loan funds after tuition and fees — meant to help with books, food, and personal expenses.

Your roommate Jamie sees the notification and grins:

“Nice! That’s your semester fun money — you earned it!”

But you also remember your financial aid counselor saying: “Refunds are part of your loan — if you don’t need it, you can send it back to reduce what you owe later.”

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Keep the money and use it for school supplies, food, and maybe a few personal expenses. It’s there to make your semester easier.
B. Return part or all of the refund to reduce your total loan balance and save on future interest.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You said:
B
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice B Selected: Return part or all of the refund to reduce your total loan balance.

You decide not to treat the refund like “extra money.” Instead, you think long-term — if this is loan money, it’s borrowed, not earned. You log into your student account portal and return $700 of the $1,000 refund, keeping $300 for essentials.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
By returning that $700, you immediately lower your total student loan balance — and you’ll pay less interest over time.

Here’s how it breaks down:

Loan interest rate: 6%

Typical repayment term: 10 years

If you kept the full $1,000, you’d repay roughly $1,330 total.

By returning $700 now, you’ll only repay around $400 total — saving about $930 in the long run.

That’s a smart trade-off: a small sacrifice now for a big benefit later.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Reducing Principal Saves You Twice
When you pay back loan money before interest accrues, you’re lowering the principal balance — the base amount on which all future interest is calculated.
That means:

You’ll owe less total interest, and

You’ll finish repayment faster after graduation.

This is the same logic behind making extra payments on any loan — from student loans to credit cards.

By keeping just enough refund to cover your needs, you’ve shown strong financial awareness: you’re using loans as a strategic tool, not a spending boost.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A few weeks later, your laptop charger dies right before midterms. A new one costs $85 — more than you budgeted.

You could:
A. Use the remaining refund money you kept for school needs.
B. Put the purchase on a credit card and pay it off gradually to save your cash buffer.

Which do you choose — A or B?

You demonstrated financial maturity by recognizing the true cost of borrowing, understanding how interest accumulates, and making strategic choices that protect your long-term financial health.

💰 Level 3: Saving — Building a Safety Net
It’s now mid-semester. You’ve gotten comfortable managing your paychecks and expenses, and you even have a small balance of $250 left in your checking account.

You’ve been thinking more about saving — your financial literacy workshop last week mentioned the importance of an emergency fund (money set aside for unexpected costs like car repairs, medical bills, or job loss).

But you’re also juggling typical student life — club fees, campus events, and the occasional coffee splurge.

Scenario:
Your campus job just deposited another $280 paycheck. After covering your monthly expenses, you have $120 left over.

You could:

A. Set aside that $120 in a high-yield savings account to start an emergency fund — even if it means fewer social outings this month.
B. Keep the money in your checking account and use it for convenience — social events, eating out, and personal comfort.

✅ Choice B Selected: Put the purchase on your credit card and rebuild your savings later.

You decide not to touch your hard-earned $320 in savings. Instead, you charge the $250 bike purchase to your credit card, planning to pay it off in a month or two once you’ve worked some extra shifts.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You now have your transportation problem solved — but you’ve created a new short-term liability.

Here’s what that looks like in numbers:

Credit card balance: $250

Interest rate (APR): 24%

Minimum payment: Around $25/month

If you can’t pay it off within the next billing cycle, you’ll begin accruing interest — roughly $5 per month if unpaid. That may not sound like much, but interest compounds, and even a few missed payments can snowball.

Your $250 bike could quietly turn into $300+ over a few months if you’re not careful.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Preserving Savings vs. Avoiding Interest
You chose to preserve your cash reserves, which is emotionally reassuring — it feels safer having money in savings. But this choice introduces interest risk: the cost of borrowing to keep liquidity.

Here’s the trade-off:

Pro: You keep your emergency fund intact for other surprises.

Con: You’ll likely pay more overall if you carry the credit card balance for multiple months.

In real-world terms, this is a decision between liquidity (cash on hand) and cost of borrowing (interest). Financially, either choice can make sense depending on how soon you can repay the card.

If you pay the balance off within 30 days — no problem.
If not, your savings just became very expensive insurance.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A few weeks later, you’ve worked extra hours and have $280 in your checking account. The credit card bill for $250 just came due.

You could:
A. Pay off the full $250 balance now to avoid any interest and reset your finances.
B. Make the $25 minimum payment to keep flexibility in your budget and pay the rest off over time.

Which do you choose — A or B?

Absolutely — let’s reset and rerun Level 3: Saving — The Stolen Bike cleanly from the start.

💰 Level 3: Saving — The Stolen Bike (Restart)
It’s late spring at Baybridge University. The quad is full of students studying in the sun, and you’re wrapping up the semester while thinking about summer plans.

You’ve been working steadily at the campus bookstore, and your savings account has grown to $320 — the most you’ve ever saved. You’re proud of it.

Then one morning, bad news hits your phone:

🚲 Your bike — your main transportation to work — was stolen.

Replacing it will cost about $250, even for a used one.

Now you have to decide how to handle it:

You could use your savings, which would wipe out most of it.

Or, you could charge it to your credit card and pay it off later to keep your savings intact.

You sip your coffee, running the numbers in your head.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Use your savings to buy a used replacement bike now — that’s what emergency funds are for.
B. Put the purchase on your credit card and rebuild your savings later — you’ll avoid draining your cash.

Which do you choose — A or B?

A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice A Selected: Use your savings to buy a used replacement bike.

You decide to dip into your $320 savings and buy a used bike for $250. You lose most of your cushion, but you get your transportation back quickly and avoid taking on debt.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
Savings balance (after purchase): $70

Credit card balance: $0

Bike replaced: ✅

You’ve solved the problem immediately and debt-free. That’s a textbook example of using an emergency fund for its true purpose — handling unexpected but necessary expenses without borrowing.

Had you charged it to your card instead, even one missed payment could have added interest at 24% APR — turning that $250 bike into $275–$300 over just a few months.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: The Role of Emergency Savings
This choice highlights an essential principle:

Savings protect you from needing credit when life happens.

An emergency fund isn’t meant to sit untouched forever — it’s a buffer against surprises that would otherwise create debt.

By using your savings now, you avoided:

Paying high credit card interest

Risking late fees

Increasing your credit utilization ratio

The only short-term downside is that your savings dropped to $70 — but you can rebuild it over the summer.

Decision Point 2️⃣
Two weeks later, you receive your next paycheck — $280. You’ve caught up on your normal expenses, and you’re ready to decide what to do with what’s left.

You could:
A. Start rebuilding your emergency fund right away — set aside $100 in savings before spending anything else.
B. Treat yourself to a small reward (like concert tickets or a weekend trip) since you’ve been financially responsible all semester.

Which do you choose — A or B?

try this scenario instead: It’s the end of sophomore year, and finals are (finally) over. You’ve landed a summer internship at a local nonprofit in Boston — part-time, paying $15/hour, 20 hours a week.
It’s your first consistent paycheck outside campus work, and it feels amazing.
After your first month, your checking account balance is $950 — more money than you’ve had in a while. Jamie, now your off-campus roommate, suggests celebrating:
“We should go on a weekend trip to Cape Cod! Split an Airbnb, get seafood, make memories before adulting hits.”
You check your budget. You’ll need to start paying your share of next semester’s off-campus rent deposit soon — $600 is due in a month. You could technically afford both the trip and the deposit, but it would leave your savings close to zero.
A. Go on the Cape Cod trip — experiences matter, and you can always save again next month.
B. Skip the trip and save for your rent deposit first, building your emergency cushion before spending on fun.

Excellent — that’s a perfect and realistic Level 3: Saving scenario. Let’s dive in.

💰 Level 3: Saving — The Cape Cod Temptation
It’s the end of sophomore year at Baybridge University. Finals are over, and you finally get to breathe again.

You’ve landed a summer internship at a nonprofit in Boston — part-time, $15/hour, 20 hours a week. It’s your first steady paycheck outside campus work, and it feels amazing.

After your first month, your checking account balance sits at $950 — more money than you’ve had in a long time.

Your roommate Jamie, always the social planner, has an idea:

“We should go on a weekend trip to Cape Cod! Split an Airbnb, get seafood, make memories before adulting hits.”

It sounds great — but you remember that your off-campus rent deposit ($600) is due in a month.

You could technically afford both the trip and the deposit, but doing so would leave your savings near zero.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Go on the Cape Cod trip — experiences matter, and you can always save again next month.
B. Skip the trip and save for your rent deposit first, building your emergency cushion before spending on fun.

Which do you choose — A or B?

A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ Choice A Selected: Go on the Cape Cod trip.

You decide to treat yourself — you’ve been working hard, finals are over, and you want to make the most of summer. You book your share of the Airbnb, set aside a little for seafood and travel, and head to Cape Cod for a relaxing weekend.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
The trip costs about $350 total, leaving you with $600 left in checking — just enough to cover your upcoming rent deposit, but not much else.

When that deposit is due next month, your balance will drop close to zero, leaving little room for emergencies or unexpected costs. Even a small setback — like a medical bill or transportation expense — could push you into using credit or borrowing from friends.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: Spending Trade-offs and Opportunity Cost
Your decision reflects an important financial truth:

Every dollar you spend today has a future purpose you might not see yet.

By spending on the trip, you gained an experience (and probably great memories), but you traded away financial flexibility — your “safety margin.”

The opportunity cost here is not having a cushion for future needs. When you live close to zero, one surprise expense can force you into high-interest debt or missed payments.

Still, spending on meaningful experiences isn’t “wrong” — the key is to plan those moments while keeping a buffer for essentials. The lesson: save for fun as a category, not as an afterthought.

Decision Point 2️⃣
Two weeks after the trip, your rent deposit clears, and your account balance dips to $40. You’ve got another paycheck coming in a week, but you’re feeling the pinch.

You could:
A. Use your credit card for small purchases (food, transportation) until payday — just to stay comfortable.
B. Tighten your spending temporarily — use your campus meal plan, walk instead of ridesharing, and rebuild your balance next month.

Which do you choose — A or B?

Got it — let’s restart Level 3: Saving — The Cape Cod Temptation from the beginning for a clean, full run.

💰 Level 3: Saving — The Cape Cod Temptation (Restart)
It’s the end of sophomore year at Baybridge University. Finals are finally over, and campus is buzzing with summer plans.

You’ve landed a part-time summer internship at a nonprofit in Boston — $15/hour, 20 hours a week. It’s your first steady income outside of campus jobs, and after your first month, your checking account balance hits $950 — more money than you’ve had in a long time.

Then your roommate Jamie, ever the social one, says:

“We should go on a weekend trip to Cape Cod! Split an Airbnb, get seafood, make memories before adulting hits.”

It sounds great — but you know that your off-campus rent deposit ($600) is due in a month.

Technically, you could afford both the trip and the deposit, but it would leave your savings nearly wiped out.

Decision Point 1️⃣
You could:

A. Go on the Cape Cod trip — experiences matter, and you can always save again next month.
B. Skip the trip and save for your rent deposit first, building your emergency cushion before spending on fun.

Which do you choose — A or B?

✅ Choice B Selected: Skip the trip and save for your rent deposit.

You take a deep breath, thank Jamie for the invite, and explain that you’ve got to prioritize your rent deposit this month. It’s not the most exciting choice, but it’s the responsible one.

💰 Immediate Financial Impact
You skip the Cape Cod trip and keep your $950 intact. When the $600 rent deposit comes due, you pay it easily — still leaving about $350 in your account.

That $350 becomes your emergency cushion — a safety net that protects you if something unexpected happens (a health copay, car trouble, or even just a slow week at work).

By resisting the impulse to spend, you’ve kept your budget balanced and avoided potential debt.

🧠 Financial Literacy Insight: “Pay Future You First”
This decision reflects a cornerstone of healthy financial habits: delayed gratification — choosing long-term stability over short-term fun.

You applied two smart saving principles here:

Prioritize essentials and obligations first — housing costs, in this case, come before leisure.

Keep a buffer — even a few hundred dollars can prevent a crisis later.

Research consistently shows that having even $250–$500 in emergency savings dramatically reduces financial stress and reliance on credit cards or loans when life throws surprises your way.

You didn’t say no to fun forever — you just made sure your financial foundation is solid first.

Decision Point 2️⃣
A week later, you get another paycheck from your internship. You now have $450 available after all bills are covered.

You could:
A. Transfer $200 into a high-yield savings account to start earning interest and continue building your emergency fund.
B. Reward yourself for your discipline — use part of your paycheck for a smaller weekend day trip or fun outing.

Which do you choose — A or B?
