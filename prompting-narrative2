🎓 Welcome to the College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator!
You’re a first-year college student at a Massachusetts university, and you’re about to face a series of financial decisions that will shape your semester—and your financial health.

The simulation has three levels, each focused on a key financial literacy area:

Budgeting 💰

Debt & Credit Management 💳

Saving & Investing 📈

You’ll make two decisions per level, and after each, you’ll get a clear explanation of what happened and why—based on real-world data and financial principles.

🏫 Level 1: Budgeting
You’ve just arrived on campus. You receive $2,500 from your summer job and a $1,000 refund from your student loan to cover living expenses for the semester (about 4 months).

You’ll need to budget for:

Food & groceries 🍔

Transportation 🚲

Social activities 🎟️

Miscellaneous costs (laundry, supplies, etc.) 🧺

Decision 1: Setting Up Your Budget
How will you plan your spending?

A. Create a detailed monthly budget using an app or spreadsheet, tracking all expenses and setting limits for each category.
B. Estimate costs loosely, checking your balance occasionally but not tracking every expense.
C. Spend as needed and check your account only when you get low on funds.

What’s your choice? (A, B, or C)

use this scenario for level 2: You’ve been managing your money pretty well — your savings are around $180, and you’ve kept your expenses mostly on track.
But as you scroll online one night, you see a deal that makes you pause:
A new laptop — lightweight, fast, perfect for your psych research papers — marked down from $900 to $750.
You’ve been struggling with your old, slow laptop for months. Then you notice a button under the price: “Buy Now, Pay Later — 0% interest for 4 months!”
It sounds easy: $187.50 per month for four months, no interest if you pay on time.
You know this could help you now — but it also means committing to payments that will shrink your future flexibility.
A. Use the Buy Now, Pay Later plan — it’s interest-free, and a new laptop will make schoolwork easier.
B. Wait and save — you’ll keep using your current laptop until you can pay for a new one in full

Excellent — that’s a perfect setup for Level 2: Debt & Credit Management.
Let’s begin.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management
Scenario:
You’ve managed your money pretty well — your savings are around $180, and you’ve stayed mostly on budget.

But as you scroll online one night, a deal catches your eye:
A new laptop, lightweight and fast — perfect for your psych research papers — marked down from $900 to $750.

You’ve been struggling with your old, slow laptop for months. Then you see a button under the price:

“Buy Now, Pay Later — 0% interest for 4 months!”

That means $187.50 per month for four months, with no interest if you pay on time.

It sounds like a great opportunity, but it also means committing to payments that could limit your flexibility over the next semester.

Decision 1: What do you do?
A. Use the Buy Now, Pay Later plan — it’s interest-free, and a new laptop will make schoolwork easier.
B. Wait and save — you’ll keep using your current laptop until you can pay in full.

What’s your choice? (A or B)

You said:
A
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ You chose A: Use the Buy Now, Pay Later plan.

💡 Outcome:
You purchase the new laptop through the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) plan. You’ll pay $187.50 each month for four months, and as long as you make every payment on time, you’ll avoid interest.

However, your savings drop from $180 to nearly $0 after the first payment, leaving you little cushion for emergencies or unexpected expenses. You’ll now have a fixed monthly obligation that reduces your flexibility.

📘 Financial Literacy Insight:
BNPL services like Afterpay, Klarna, and Affirm have become popular—especially among college students. They’re convenient, but they can also create hidden risks:

Short-term credit: BNPL isn’t a credit card, but it’s still a form of short-term borrowing. Missing a payment can trigger late fees or even credit score damage if the provider reports to credit bureaus.

Cash flow risk: Even “interest-free” debt ties up your future income. If an unexpected cost (like a car repair or medical bill) arises, you could end up relying on higher-interest credit later.

Behavioral trap: BNPL can make spending feel painless, which increases the chance of impulse buying.

In this case: Your new laptop helps academically — a justifiable expense — but your margin for error is slim. The key is timely payments and avoiding stacking other BNPL purchases.

Decision 2: One month later
You’ve made your first payment on time. But now, a friend invites you on a weekend trip that would cost about $120 — and your account balance is only $60.

You could:
A. Use a credit card to cover the trip, planning to pay it off next month.
B. Decline the trip and focus on rebuilding your savings before taking on more debt.

What’s your next move? (A or B)

try this decision again
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
Absolutely — let’s replay Decision 2 of Level 2 with a clean slate.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management — Decision 2
You’ve been making your Buy Now, Pay Later laptop payments on time — two down, two to go. Your classes are running smoother with the new computer, but your budget is tight.

Your checking account sits at $60, and your next BNPL payment of $187.50 is due in about two weeks.

Then your friend group invites you on a weekend trip that would cost $120 total (gas, food, and lodging). You don’t have the cash — but you do have a credit card with a $500 limit and no current balance.

Your options:
A. Use your credit card for the trip and plan to pay it off next month.
B. Skip the trip and focus on rebuilding your savings before taking on more debt.

What’s your choice? (A or B)

You said:
try decision 1 again
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
Sure — let’s rewind Level 2, Decision 1 and walk through it fresh.

💳 Level 2: Debt & Credit Management
Scenario:
You’ve been managing your money responsibly — about $180 in savings, and your semester expenses are mostly under control.

Then you spot a tempting online offer:
A new laptop — lightweight, fast, perfect for your psych research — discounted from $900 to $750.

Your old laptop has been lagging and crashing during big projects. Beneath the price, a button reads:

“Buy Now, Pay Later — 0% interest for 4 months!”

That’s $187.50 per month for four months — no interest if you pay every installment on time.

You could have the laptop now… but it means committing to payments that will tighten your budget for the next few months.

Decision 1: What do you do?
A. Use the Buy Now, Pay Later plan — it’s interest-free, and a new laptop will make schoolwork easier.
B. Wait and save — you’ll keep using your current laptop until you can pay in full.

What’s your choice? (A or B)

You said:
B
College Factual Financial Literacy Simulator said:
✅ You chose B: Wait and save.

💡 Outcome:
You decide to hold off on buying the laptop and keep using your old one while you save. It’s not ideal — your assignments take a bit longer, and you deal with some frustration — but your finances remain flexible and secure.

Your $180 savings stays intact, and you continue adding small amounts each week from your part-time job or leftover funds. Within a few months, you could afford to buy the laptop outright without any debt or payment obligations.

📘 Financial Literacy Insight:
Choosing to save and pay in full protects you from the risks of short-term debt and keeps your cash flow predictable. Here’s why this approach is financially strong:

Avoids debt creep: Even “0% interest” plans can lead to missed payments and surprise fees. Some BNPL services charge $25–$40 for a single late payment.

Protects your credit: BNPL companies sometimes report late payments to credit bureaus — which can lower your credit score for years.

Builds true savings discipline: By waiting, you strengthen a lifelong financial habit: delaying gratification to make smarter long-term decisions.

Improves financial resilience: With cash in reserve, you’re better prepared for unplanned costs — like a medical bill, a phone repair, or a sudden textbook fee.

Your choice shows excellent financial restraint and planning. 💪
